## SQLBits 2023 the other Side
Spoiler Alert, it's not much different.

# Arriving On Site (Monday)

While SQLBits officially started on the Tuesday, there are things to do before everyone arrives.

1) For the Organisers and (some) Helpers, there is <em>bag packing</em>, getting the venue organized and picking up #TeamOrange uniform for the week (aka Orange shirts)
1) Helping out at the pre-training <b>Meet the Speaker</b> session, for #BitsBuddies, this is the first chance to get involved and help out, they maybe in an older Orange shirt as it's not the first day.

This part of my trip has mixed luck, in past years I've not managed to get into the venue due to security.
<br>Being able to get in, allowed me to get familiar with the layout and different routes between rooms, that can be useful when most attendees crowd the most direct routes.

And for SQLBits 2023, confirmed with the <em>hills</em>, I'd be using the SQLBits Bus each day.

# Day One (Tuesday) Chaos

Ok, this can vary year to year and be part of the reason registration opens a little later than advertised.

As with any large event, there are last minute issues to induce stress and confusion, with an amazing committee and more experienced helpers, most attendees may only notice a delay in getting registered and a last minute room change.

For Helpers, this is why it can be tougher to be selected to help on the first day (or two), it's not that you can't help out, just people who've been through it before and can be relied on, help to keep the illusion that nothing is wrong (and honestly, everything was fine in 2023)

# Being a Helper

For those who've never helped out, there is not a lot of difference for most helpers
- You get to attend Sessions, one you'd like to attend
- You're asked to help with 2-4 session per day you help, though never do back-2-back sessions (yes, I've done that and unless it's the same room you don't have time to help as you need to)
- You have one of two roles while moderating a session

    - Helping the Speaker, where you introducer yourself (and co-helper)
    <br>Check they have everything the need and the AV is working for them (the AV team and <em>Runners</em> are on hand, so you don't have to fix anything)
    <br>Check the time countdown alerts they get, two times are mandatory in all sessions
    <br><br>For <em>chatty</em> speakers, <em>kick them off stage</em>
    <br>This is rare, there will be another speaker waiting to get ready and sessions need to keep to the schedule

    - Manage the room, not as easy at it may sound in comparison and you may not see as much of the session
    <br>For the start of the session, you'll help attendees make sure they have the correct session, sometimes the rooms change or signs are wrong
    <br><br>For popular sessions, this can evolve into a <b>bouncer</b> role, where you hang the <em>session full</em> sign and prevent attendees getting in, after all there are room limits for everyone's safety.
    <br>This is rare and with good planning the sessions are normally in suitably sized rooms, and there are likely other *not helping* helpers who can assist
    <br><br>Record Room numbers, this something mid-session, as people arrive late or leave as they got the wrong session. It's just a matter of counting the attendees in the room, so the speakers know how popular the session was. 
    <br><br>Session end &amp; Handover. If you can, let the speaker and attendee know they can chat outside the room, then help them exit
    <br>Some speakers get a lot of questions and need assistance moving the chat out of the room. Yes, we want the speaker &amp; attendees to keep talk, just there will be another session that needs to start.
    <br>Part of why you should never do back-2-back sessions, you need to check the helpers for the next session arrive and share any notes about the room they may need to know, e.g. the camera man snores (ok, maybe they don't and enjoyed the session too)

- Oh yes, you have to wear your Orange shirt and keep it visible, even if the venue is cold, that means no coat or anything else to prevent attendees knowing you're part of #TeamOrange

There are a few terms for the helpers, some say the Orange Army, though I prefer #TeamOrange, after all we're friendly and helpful, not fighting a war.

# The 'Other' Helpers

Some members of #TeamOrange may not be as noticeable, yet do a **lot** more that is not seen, at least when things are not going smoothly (which is rare, honest).

They are the **Runners**, the ones with radios who are running around the venue and may only see a few minutes of any session over the full conference.
<br>They can be a big help, so pay respect, and help them to help you, even if that's just taking a step back so they can get past quicker.

While the Runners have been part of SQLBits for as long as I can remember, in 2022 a new sub-set of Helpers, the **#BitsBuddies**, came along and I'm lucky enough to be part of the group.
<br>The like the Runners, the #BitsBuddies are 'on duty' all day, or at least while we wear whatever <b>Buddies</b> identification Item we have, an armband that didn't fit in 2023.
<br>For those who don't know, the #BitsBuddies are there to help attendee's to be more involved and get the most they can from the event, that can be as simple as getting someone to a session
<br>Or for 1st time/solo attendees, helping them mingle and network with others.

Yes, we know how difficult it can be to become <em>one or the cool gang</em> when you don't know anyone, that why there are <b>Buddies</b>, the #BitsBuddies

And what they didn't tell us, it doesn't stop on the Saturday after Prize Giving, the #BitsBuddies arr around <b>ALL</b> Year, check out the PodCast, keep an eye out for random posts on Social Media for next year's event or when the Videos from this year are available.

# The Committee

Often overlooked, the committee work hard all year long to plan an amazing event.
<br>Though with everything going on, may not be as approachable as they'd like to be during the event.

Yet, they are the most stressed and most in need of the Friday Night Party.

# Volunteering Summary

This is not for everyone, it does require a little extra commitment to the conference and to make time pre-event for meetings and finding out how things run that year.

For those looking to help out or contribute something back to the community, it is easier than starting a blog / youtube channel or becoming a Speaker.
<br>And if you are helping, there are plenty of people who've done it before to help you out.

And mentioning Speakers, over the past few years, it's been noticeable how many Speaker are also Helpers.
