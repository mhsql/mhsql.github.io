## Post Conference, Hotel Three and the Flight Home

# Checkout &amp; Back to Manchester

This is when it starts to hit home that SQLBits is over for another year.
<br>After a few issues when traveling home on the Saturday, I now stay over on the Saturday night and start my return Sunday.
<br>That's not just because I've now got a 6,000 miles journey.

Doing final checks, everything is packed, including all the new t-shirts and other swag collected, remembering to leave anything not essential, I do have a weight limit for my return flight.
<br>Maybe you car/train/bus had a space limit, not everyone can carry a bean bag home.

In 2023, post checkout I shared a taxi to the train station, for my onward journey back to Manchester and my flight home.

Yes, another Train transfer, and no less stressful or empty.
<br>I think I hit a busy period, as arriving in Manchester, the train was full.
<br>Instead of a nice long and pleasant intercity train journey, the one's you see on TV. I need to squeeze into a seat with my case for a few hours.

This is something that can be easier to deal with on a Sunday, too many post (soccer) match supports traveling home or party goers heading out on a Saturday.

# Manchester (Airport) Hotel No. 3

As my flight leaves in the morning, I've missed out on a Sunday flight, so another hotel before I can check-in for my flight.
<br>Ok, in the modern connected world, I've completed my online check-in and selected my seat already.

To help manage my stress and any issues getting to the Airport, my hotel in next to the Terminal I'm flying from, so just a road to cross and no late taxi / bad traffic to worry about.

Something people don't alway make time for when flying, is getting to the Airport &amp; all the checks.
<br>The check-in queue can be a 20-30 minute wait and the same again for security and immigration.
<br>Then you need to be at the gate 20 minutes before take off

Some Airlines recommend arriving 2 hours before departure, I aim for 3 hours or when the check-in will open, you may have an hour's wait before you can get to the gate.

# Flying Home

Ok, I paid a little extra for an upgraded seat and with my frequent flier status have Lounge access anyway.
<br>The priority security was a pleasant extra, which reduces a possible 20-30 minute queue at security, to a few minutes.

Business or Leisure, it's the little extras like priority security and even a <em>public</em> lounge that can make getting through the airport a little easier.
<br>I did check the paid options before traveling, just Manchester Airport website would only let me booking going from & returning to Manchester, not the other way around.

I managed to book a direct flight, due to routing 13 hours onboard and I'm home, well nearly.
<br>While early 2023 Hong Kong Airport was still feeling the affect of low traveler numbers post covid, the flow from Aircraft to Immigration is smooth, with train and moving walkways.
<br>Having an resident card, Immigration is an automated gate and never more than a couple of people (if anyone) queuing.

# Going Home Summary

While the fun, stress and noise of the conference is over, it's not the end of stress.
<br>Depending on where you are returning to, there are many challenges left and planning ahead for an extra night, overnight stops or just a few <em>luxury</em> extras can help.

Yes, my return travel was 6,000 miles, though even when in the UK and it was 500 miles, I still had issues and more stress returning as I had going.

Even for SQL Relay / SQL Saturday events, or just a User Group, there is always something to cause stress when traveling.

For some people that may be too much and stop then getting involved, so next time to ask a colleague to go with you, spare a thought and think about how you can really help them to join in.
<br>Or check if there's a meet-up or other online option that may be better for them, though the real learning at SQLBits is the networking.
