## Off to Newport and Hotel Two

# Hotel Checkout

After a day with Family and time to recover from my flight, Monday morning and hotel checkout.

As ever, the pre check-out process invloves many room checks, when re-packing items used during the two days and any gifts I picked up.

In the UK, handing back the key and obtaining my invoice
<br>Some hotels provide a speed check-out when you just drop the key and have the invoice emailed.

In some other countries, your check-out may include a room check, what you didn't declare using from the min-bar, not things you forgot.

Stress levels at check-out can vary, a lot, depending on where you are, if you pre-paid or need to find a credit card (with limit free) to pay.
<br>Then add in, parnaoi about forgetting something.

# Catching a Train

I had booked my train to Newport online, the mobile app had the  ticket and travel details.

While that may sound great, not knowing the train station, I still need to find my way around and get to a suiatble place on the platform.
<br>One thing I like in Asia, some countries had dedicated platforms per train route/size, so if you have a seat in carriage F, it is maked out an easy to find.

In the UK, it's not uncommon for delays or overbooked trains as tickets can be for open travel on any train. so even if you know your carriage, good luck finding a seat.

And one final task, getting some cash from an ATM, not knowing if I could UBER to my hotel.
<br>Even with the rise of e-wallets and mobile payment, not all companies accept them, so it's always good to have some local money, while trying to avoid carrying to much and the fear of being robbed.

# Train Transfer

Finally onboard, while it's a long distance trip, the train is more like a short local train with limited seating and storage space
<br>I take a seat and keep my suitcase close, with other baggage, not comfortable for a ling journey.

And to keep busy, I isloate myself listening to music, checking social media and play some mobile games

While tweeting as I travelled, I noticed a photo reply from a fellow BitsBuddy, they had got on the same train.
<br>As I prefere to keep to my self when travelling, I dodn't say hello until we arrived in Newport and then shared an UBER, as we where in the same hotel.

The Train to Hotel was another <b>fun</b> experience, with building work at the train station and no visible taxi stand, UBER was the primary option for a taxi in a foriegn city.

Once in the Hotel, then the fun of unpacking for the week and finding out how to get around and to the venue.

# (Train) Transfer Summary

Travel within a country can depend on the country, some have good public transport networks that are clean, frequent and reliable.
<br>Others, not as cheap or reliable, making things tough, even for regular travellers.

For me, on this trip, Train was the primary option.
<br>For SQLBits 2022, flying was the primary choice.
<br>And before leaving the UK, I even had a shared drive with co-workers one year.

Each have their challenges and stress points, some may be more convient while other expensive or arriving miles from where you need to be, meaning a Taxi at some point.

And even when travelling for friends or family, some journey's need some personal time, so you can reduce some of the stress.

Again, the complexity to book, reliability or cost and need or personal time, can impact some peoples choice to travel (anywhere)
<br>This is one reason, SQLBits 2024 still being a hybrid event really helps those who can't travel, even the short distance, to attend.
