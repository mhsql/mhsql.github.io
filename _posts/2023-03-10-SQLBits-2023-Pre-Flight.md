## Last Day in the Office and Boarding the Flight

# The Last Day
With the time difference I started my series of tweets Friday morning local time, the early hours of Friday morning in the UK.

My daily commute is a walk in park, actually it's across Victoria Park, though not a stress free 15 minute walk.
<br>As with any last day, there are loose ends to tidy up, things to hand over and the usual Friday unknowns.

With my overnight flight and an easy 1 hour airport transfer, a day in the office was an option, even with my last minute packing habit.

Though for many even with a midnight flight, 9pm check-in and 7/8pm set-off times, it may not be an option.
<br>Less frequent fliers will be chasing down everything they need to take before completing their packing.

Over the years, I've learned that whatever I forget I can get when I arrive, especially in this case with the UK as my destination.

# 5pm and the Journey to SQLBits 2023 Really Starts
End of the working day, a 15 minute walk across the park, then packing starts.

Ok, I do it to myself and pack last minute, though my case and things I (really) need are always easily to hand, so it only takes an hour, as some things are not where I left them.

It's this phase where my personal stress starts to build, the kind of stress they tell you is <b>good stress</b>, the kind that keeps you alert and aware of what is going on.
<br>Even so, I take a little longer than expected and head to the MTR (underground/metro rail), where the staff are on-hand to prevent me using the easy escalator option and I have to queue for the lift to the platform, an unplanned delay.
<br>I have one change of train to the Airport Express, which at that time still had a reduced Covid based service.

# At the Airport
I'm a member of the Cathay frequent fliers programme, if you fly once a year or less, it can still be worth the free membership to sign up, today is one of those good day's.
<br>At check-in, I was advised the flight was busy and asked if I'd downgrade from Premium Economy to Economy, with a 14 hour flight and things to do when I landed, I declined.

With the lower flight numbers and automation, Security and Immigration are quick and painless, so off to the Lounge.

Ok, I've flown a bit with Cathay, so earned the status level for Lounge access.
<br>Again, with some Covid restrictions still in place, it was not the <em>full</em> Cathay experience.

The whole airport experience, check-in, security, immigration and waiting around is not the same at all airports.
<br>And for most people, it's a hot and crowded, long lines for expensive snacks and drinks. **Very** stressful and why many need a holiday to recover from their trip.

Spending a little on a public lounge can be worth the cost, even though they can still be crowded, they tend to be isolated and provide some space to rest with free food &amp; drink until it's time to board.

# 23:30 Boarding Begins
Hong Kong airport has introduced contactless boarding with a number of airlines, personally it will be great if they all used it. Though for some, there's the fear of being tracked as the airport system recognises your face.

Time to board and I look at the camera, then it tells me to go to the counter, never a good sign.
<br>In this case, good news, instead of a downgrade, I get an upgrade, a benefit of frequent flier membership and flying more than the other passengers on your flight.
<br>This does reduce my stress a little as I know I can, kind of,  sleep in-flight.

Ok, I got very lucky, given my paid seat upgrade option failed.
<br>I've done enough (ultra) long haul flights to know the benefits, so do feel a little sorry for those in coach/economy, who will struggle to relax / rest or have enough leg room.
<br>Business Class may be a <em>fold flat bed</em>, though sleep is not ideal, it's enough to arrive feeling **human**

And, ***yes***, whatever flying cheat handbooks you read, the only way to upgrade for free is to be a regular traveler with the airline.
<br>This was my second free upgrade, the first was a New Year's day flight when traveling to the UK. Having flown 6,000 miles to Paris I had the most <em>>points</em> to be upgraded on the short flight to Newcastle.

# Pre-Flight summary
For me, a **normal** Friday in the office, with a rush to pack and get to the airport, then a little relaxation while waiting around to board.
<br>And a lucky seat change.

For most, this is a combination of high stress events.
- Friday's can be tough and the weekend is always a welcome break.
- Packing can take a lot of planning, getting all the little things you need, and making sure the bag is not overweight.
- Then the Airport, depending on when you arrive, always a long queue that means the 3 hour pre-flight timing is needed to be able to get everything done.
- And security, as a techie you need to un-pack & re-pack you carry-on bag. Never mind the detector going off and the <em>>pat down</em>

If you meet me, ask about my 2021 &amp; 2022 travels, with ***full covid*** restrictions, testing and busy airports, they did have my stress levels very high.
<br>Travel during Covid was definitely for the seasoned traveler.

Maybe when you think about this, you can understand why many will look for local events, not international ones.
<br>For many just getting to the airport, never mind flying out, is a high stress time.

And keep that in mind when you think about the international speakers, they may travel a little more, just like me they **will** get stress, even if they (and I) don't admit it.
