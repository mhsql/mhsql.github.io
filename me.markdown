I was born in the North of England and started my IT Career in 2000, missing out on the Millennium Bug

Starting in a technical Call Centre, managing the knowledgebase content and providing internal training on the CRM system

Moving on to a testing role on a BI project, the developers got sick of my bug's and got me onto the development team to fix/prevent them

While that was my entry point into the world of data, with IBM DB2 and BusinessObjects (now part of SAP)
<br>My next role moved my towards the Microsoft tech stack, with SQL Server 2000 using DTS, while the main database was Progress 4GL / OpenEdge
<br>And with data dictionary issues, it was more unstructured NoSQL than relational

Moving back toward support and development, I got to grips with more of the Microsoft Stack, SSRS and migrated from DTS to SSIS

In 2012 I had my first visit to SQLBits an event I now travel 6,000 miles to attend
<br>Starting to attend SQL Saturday's, SQL Relay / Data Relay &amp; joining the Data Platform User Group in Newcastle helped me to learn and validate my knowledge

Meeting my partner in late 2014, the time zone and other issues of a long-distance relationship saw me relocate to Bangkok for a year
<br>And now has me working in Hong Kong, as part of a diverse multinational team
